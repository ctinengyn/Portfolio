# Portfolio

## Hey there, I'm Christine and welcome to my portfolio!
I have a long history with being involved with coding, when MySpace was a thing before Facebook became popular. You were known as the *"cool kid"* if you knew how to make your profile by adding banners, gifs, background images, music and etc. A few years later I was still involved with coding because Tumblr. At the time I never thought about coding could be a career because growing up in my family we told to only be engineers, doctors or business.

As I got older it was time to decide what I wanted to do with my career path. I chose to do accounting... I didn't feel passionate with the path I chose and I knew it was time for a change to better my future. I decided to enroll from a coding bootcamp - University of Washington - to learn deeper into coding. 

I am passionate about photography and videography and I love working with anything that can show my creativity. Within a month into bootcamp I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript. I still have a long way to go to fully understand what each code does, but within the next 6 months I can't to see how much I progress I made. I truly believe that learning never stops and it's never too late to make a big change to better the future.
